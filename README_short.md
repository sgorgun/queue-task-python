# Queue (python)

Set of programming assignments that are designed to test knowledge of queue data structure.


## Problem 1: Implement queue using the default interface

Your first programming assignment is to implement the provided default interface for Queue above.
Tests will check your implementation in different scenarios, for simplicity you may assume that only numeric elements will be used for testing.


## Problem 2: Implement queue using two stacks

Your task is to implement queue data structure using only two stacks. For this programming assignment you should re-use your solution for the first problem from the Stack problem set (`Problem 1: Implement stack using the default interface`).


## Problem 3: Calculate the number of islands in a given grid

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


## Problem 4: Minimum knight moves (with obstacles)

For a given `chessboard` (`8 x 8` cells) you need to determine the minimal number of moves for the knight (`K` character) to reach the destination cell (`D` character). It is guaranteed the answer exists.
